    <h2 style="text-align: center;">My Best Mediterranean cruise trip</h2>

    <p>
    On our mediterranean cruise trip that started from Barcelona, I and my family members (my husband and 2 daughters) visited some of the most coveted destinations
    in Europe, including seaside villages in Italy, culinary capitals in Spain, scenic ports in the French Rivera, and historic
    cities in Portugal and Croatia.  Also we visited Paris before embarking our cruise from Barcelona.  We reached
    Barcelona 1 day before so also got chance to stroll through the broad boulevards of Barcelona.

        
    <h3>The places we visited:</h3>

    <ul>
     <li>Paris, France</li>
     <li>Barcelona, Spain</li>
     <li>Ajaccio, Spain</li>
     <li>Marseille, France</li>
     <li>Cannes, France</li>
     <li>Nice, France</li>
     <li>Genoa, Italy</li>
     <li>Pisa, Italy</li>
     <li>Livorno, Italy</li>
     <li>Florence, Italy</li>
     <li>Rome, Italy</li>
    </ul>
    
    
        
    <h3>Paris</h3>

       <p>

        We booked our flight from Washington DC (IAD) to Paris, France(CDG).  When we landed in Paris, since it
        is around 5 hours ealier time zone, it was still evening but during that time in August, it was windy day in 
        Paris.  We booked a cab from airport and went to our Hotel.  In the evening, we visited the famous church, Montmartre.
        The next day, we went to Eiffel Tower.  We also took boat tour to other places in Paris.  The Bachir icecream at Montmartre outlet 
        is extremely popular and definately one of the best icecream parlours in Paris.

<h3>Barcelona</h3>

<p>
 We flew from Paris to Barcelona early morning.  It was my little ones birthday and she was so excited to
 celebrate her birthday.  From airport, we took a cab and went to our hotel.  We took rest for a few hours 
 and started our stroll in Barcelona.  The weather was perfect that day.  We found a perfect vegan cafe to start 
 our day with.  Then we head to Sagrada_Familia
